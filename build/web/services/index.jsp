                        Fixing gaps and replacing missing teeth is not only important for your appearance however it prevents plaque and tartar from settling into those gaps. If the bacteria is not removed, it can cause cavities, tooth decay, and sometimes even gum disease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Did you know your teeth can shift out of place? When there is nothing to maintain the space between a gap, it can cause your teeth to move out of place. This can result in issues with biting, sensitivity, and also affect the function of your jaw. A common way to close the gap and replace missing teeth is with dental implants. Some dentists prefer dental implants over bridges and dentures because they are a more permanent solution. We provide quality dental implants near you.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        How Do Dental Implants Work?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        A dental implant is composed of 3 parts: The implant screw, abutment, and the manufactured crown.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The implant screw is surgically implanted in your jawbone and acts as a replacement for the root of the tooth. The abutment is what joins the implanted screw to the manufactured crown. The crown looks just a natural tooth and is installed on the abutment. Once everything is healed, the dental implant looks and feels just like a natural tooth. Dental implants are also just as strong as a natural tooth!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a dentist determines that you are a good candidate for dental implants in Willow Park, your dentist will come up with a treatment plan to decide the best way to place them. Our experienced and professional dentists at Nexa Dental perform a guided surgery that is a non-invasive procedure. We want to make sure you feel confident going into any procedure with our dental team. Call us to book a consultation for dental implants near you at Nexa Dental. We are more than happy to assist you with any questions you may have.

                        Receiving professional teeth cleaning at least twice a year is essential for the success of your oral health. An invisible layer called plaque is coated on your teeth when consuming food or drinks. Plaque and tartar removal prevents tooth decay or other serious issues like cavities. Tooth decay is caused by bacteria in the mouth that convert sugar into acids, which erodes your tooth’s enamel. Once your tooth starts to decay, holes will appear on the enamel and create cavities. It is vital to brush twice a day and floss once a day to prevent the plaque from hardening into tartar, as well as attend regular dental cleanings near you.

                        Although it is vital to take care of your oral health at home, brushing and flossing cannot remove all the buildup caused by bacteria. Booking a dental cleaning in Willow Park at our dental clinic is the best way to remove plaque and tartar entirely. At Nexa Dental, we are committed to providing the highest quality of services for our patients!

In addition to brushing and flossing daily, scheduling regular dental check-ups near you will ensure you maintain a clean mouth and healthy smile.

                        Dental crowns are custom-designed caps that are placed over the surface of your tooth. Metal used to be the most common material used to make dental crowns however, all-ceramic crowns are now available. We provide all-ceramic dental crowns near you that are more discrete and blend in with your natural teeth. The benefits of this type of crown compared to the metal ones is that it’s less visible and it’s also equally as durable. Dental crowns can last longer than a decade if they are well maintained and properly cared for!                    </p>

                        If you are looking to receive dental crowns near you, the procedure is completed in two appointments. Your dentist will take impressions and reshape your tooth during the first appointment. The impressions will be used to create your custom crown that matches the size, shape, and colour of your natural teeth. The fabrication process can take a few weeks, so your dentist will provide you with a temporary crown to protect your tooth in the meantime.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During the second visit, your dentist will permanently cement the custom crown on to your tooth. The custom dental crown will restore the original appearance and function of your tooth. If you are interested in receiving dental crowns in Willow Park, contact us today to schedule a consultation!

                        Some side effects patients experience include soreness and tenderness in the mouth. This is a result of the dentist grinding down your teeth. Tenderness and bleeding of the gums is also another side effect that people experience after the procedure. Within a few days, the soreness will go away but the gums may require a few weeks to heal completely.

                        If you choose to be sedated, you should avoid driving right after the procedure. In order to ensure your dental bridges remain in good shape:

                        Missing one or more teeth is very common for most people in North America. Losing a tooth can leave a big impact on your everyday life. Not only can it affect your appearance, but it can also cause difficulty in performing simple tasks like chewing or speaking. If you are considering getting a tooth replaced, receiving dentures in Willow park may be right for you!

It is important to note that dentures are not as strong as a natural tooth however, they restore functions like chewing, eating, and speaking. We offer high-quality dentures near you at Nexa Dental, allowing you to be comfortable and confident in your smile!

                        Our teeth are composed of several layers. The enamel is the outer layer that surrounds the dentin. Layers of hard tissue are inside the dentin and make up the root canal system. The root canal system contains soft pulp with nerves and blood vessels. The nutrients our teeth need are provided by this strand of pulp which contains nerves extending from the tooth, down into the root. The root of the tooth begins to die if the tissue becomes infected or injured. If proper treatment is not received in time, the whole tooth can end up dying as well. Root canal therapy is used to prevent a damaged tooth from dying.

                        Our number one priority at Nexa Dental is to provide you with the best treatments and make you feel as comfortable as possible. When you come into our clinic for root canal treatment near you, our dentist will make sure you are numbed thoroughly before starting your treatment. Next, our dentist will make a small hole in your tooth in order to reach the root canal. This hole will allow our dentist to remove the pulp and clean the inside of the tooth before sealing and filling it back up. Please contact us if you have any questions about receiving root canal therapy near you.

                        Taking good care of your teeth after they have been whitened is important to maintain your pearly whites. In order to preserve the colour, avoid substances that may cause stains on your teeth like soft drinks, coffee, red wine, and acidic beverages. If you frequently consume any of these, you may see the colour wear faster. Luckily, your teeth will be more resistant to stains if you professionally whiten your teeth as opposed to whitening them with over the counter solutions. Call us to request a teeth whitening consultation today! At Nexa Dental, we provide quality teeth whitening near you.

                        Your smile is unique and special, why not be confident with it! At Nexa Dental, we offer porcelain veneers that can fix cosmetic concerns you have about your teeth. Veneers are thin porcelain shells that are bonded to the front surface of your teeth to enhance your smile. With porcelain veneers, you can achieve the smile you’ve always dreamed of! If you are looking to enhance your smile or correct various dental issues, you may want to consider getting porcelain veneers near you!

                    </h2>   

                    <p>
                        Once your dentist has confirmed if you are a good candidate for porcelain veneers, your dentist will create a treatment plan based on your smile concerns and goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your dentist will lightly etch the surface of your teeth in order to create a sufficient surface for the veneers to bond to. This process is usually done without an anesthetic however, you can speak to your dentist about anesthetic options if you feel more comfortable having an anesthetic administered. Your dentist will then take an impression of your teeth which will be sent to a laboratory for the fabrication of your custom veneers. The fabricating process can take up to two weeks,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the veneers are ready, your Willow Park dentist will carefully adhere each veneer to its assigned tooth. The last step is to buff and polish the veneers to fit over your natural teeth. If you are looking to have a smile transformation, contact us to schedule a consultation! We offer the best veneers in Willow park at Nexa Dental!
